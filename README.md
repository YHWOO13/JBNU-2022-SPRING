# JBNU-2022-SPRING
- Project 1: Propose a change in line 18 of [Program 2-3] <br>
- Project 2: With the handwritten numeric dataset provided by sklearn, learn from the following two models and measure performance.<br>
  2-1 Modify [Program 3-5]
  2-2 SVM: Adjust C and kernel hyperparameters
  2-3 Random forest: adjust n_estimators and max_depth hyperparameters<br>
- Project 3: Build a convolutional neural network classifying CIFAR 100 using Tensorflow.<br>
  3-1 Experiment with multiple neural network structures and multiple hyperparameters to produce the highest performance model.<br>
  3-2 Select two to three types of hyperparameters that you think are important and optimize them.<br>
  3-3 Use 5-layer cross-validation for performance experiments. Measure top-1 and top-5 accuracy <br>
- Project 4:Create interesting applications with the face detection, face mesh detection, hand detection, and posture estimation capabilities provided by MediaPipe. Make UI using PyQt.<br>
